# Pragmatic Android Dependency Injection

This repository contains resources for my "Pragmatic Android Dependency Injection" workshop.

## Goals

This workshop builds:

- **Understanding** of DI principles and benefits.
- **Experience** adding manual DI to common Android architectures.
- **Awareness** of the costs/benefits of DI frameworks.

Participants should leave feeling empowered to champion the introduction of manual DI in Android codebases they work on.

## Self-Study

All workshop resources are collected in this repository. Before beginning, you should have:

- Android Studio 3.4.1 or newer installed.
- A basic awareness of unit testing.
- A basic awareness of common Android app architectures (MVC, MVP, MVVM).

When you are ready to begin:

1. Clone this respository.
2. Read through the slides in the [part1-slides](part1-slides/) folder.
3. Work through the refactors described in [part2-refactor/guide.md](part2-refactor/guide.md) using the [part2-refactor/SpeedySubs](part2-refactor/SpeedySubs) Android app codebase.

Please reach out to me if you have unanswered questions!
